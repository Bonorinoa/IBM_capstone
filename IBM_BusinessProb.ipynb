            "source": "In the city of San Fracisco, after a certain hour, danger increases in some areas. These areas have been labeled as high crime rate zones or dangerous areas at night and I believe both people (customers) and business owners could probably informed beforehand of this if trying to open a business or maybe practice tourism around those areas. Tourists usually are not aware of dangerous neighborhoods or areas like locals are. Same goes for the entrepreneur who moves to a different city (in this case San Francisco but could potentially be implemented on numerous cities) or country seeking better opportunities to start a business. Using a dataset of crime rates in San Fracisco plus the foursquare API to map cafes/restaurants/nightclubs/bars I will plot both datasets. That could be used by business owners for three things:\n- Locate areas of low business density to identify a proper location to set up their business.\n- Be aware of the crime rates on such area beforehand and organize their business accordingly to prevent an undesired event.\n- Publish on their profile how safe their store is to gain customers confidence.\nAnd it could be helpful for tourists or potential customers for the following:\n- Analyze the crime rates of an area and prepare accordingly before going to visit such location. \n- Get information about how the business, say nightclub, is prepared."
